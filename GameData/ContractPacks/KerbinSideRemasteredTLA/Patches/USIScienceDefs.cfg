        default = You take an aquatic sample. Don't drink it this is for science 
        //KerbinSrfSplashedWater = A fuzzy, indistinct snake-like object appears briefly on the screen
        //KerbinSrfLandedMountains = The stunning scenery of snowcapped peaks takes your breath away. Or maybe it's just the altitude. Hard to tell.
        //KerbinSrfLandedMidlands = Oh, the green green hills of Kerbin, calling you home...
        //KerbinSrfLandedDesert = There is beauty here, after a fashion. It leaves you thirsting for more.
        //LaytheSrfSplashed = You wonder if you brought your towel.
        //LaytheSrfLanded = You wonder if you brought your towel.

        //DresSrfLandedMidlands = It is grey.
        //DresSrfLandedHighlands = It is gris.
        //DresSrfLandedCanyons = It is grau.
        //DresSrfLandedRidges = From this high vantage point you have a spectacularly panoramic view. Of endless gray sameness, as far as the camera can see...
        //DresSrfLandedPoles = A philosopher once said "The world is neither black nor white, but exists in shades of gray." He must've been from Dres.
        //DunaSrfLanded = The fine red dust hanging in the atmosphere creates spectacular sunsets. You wish you had someone to share it with.
        //EveSrfLanded = The sun filtering through the dense atmosphere paints the scene in jewel like tones.
